# Hi, I'm Lee Grobler

I’m a passionate frontend developer with a journey that began in 2016 as a full-stack developer. After exploring both sides of the stack, I found my true calling in frontend development in 2018, specializing in Vue.js and Nuxt.js. Since then, I've been working on numerous projects focusing on creating intuitive, responsive user interfaces. While Vue is my primary framework, I’ve also gained experience in Angular, React (Next.js), and various frontend tools like CSS, TypeScript, Node.js, and Express.js.

## What I’m Currently Working On

In my spare time I’m developing a React and Firebase app that automates TikTok video creation. The app takes Reddit posts, uses OpenAI to convert them into story scripts, applies text-to-speech for narration, fetches a video from the Pexels API, and combines everything into a polished TikTok-ready video.

## What I’m Currently Learning

I’m revisiting my React and Next.js skills while exploring more advanced frontend architectures and tools.

## What I’m Looking to Collaborate On

I’m interested in dynamic frontend projects that go beyond simple CRUD UIs. This includes projects involving video manipulation, interactive SVGs, canvas animations, game development, or anything utilizing novel APIs and technologies.
